    "# Diabetes Health Survey Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The **Diabetes Health Survey** collects valuable information about individuals' health and diabetes management. This project aims to understand users' needs better and provide effective support for managing diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Interface**: A graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter, allowing users to input their health data easily.\n",
    "- **Data Storage**: Responses are stored in an SQLite database for secure and organized data management.\n",
    "- **Data Export**: Users can export survey data to an Excel file for analysis and reporting.\n",
    "- **Data Visualization**: Future enhancements may include visual representations of the data using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Survey Process\n",
    "1. **User Input**: \n",
    "   - Users enter their name and email.\n",
    "   - Select options for age group, gender, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and other health-related questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**:\n",
    "   - Upon submission, responses are collected and saved in the `survey_responses` table within the SQLite database.\n",
    "   - The program confirms successful data entry with a message box.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Export**:\n",
    "   - Users can export the collected data to an Excel file for further analysis. This feature uses the Pandas library, ensuring that data is written correctly and can be opened without encoding issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Future Enhancements**:\n",
    "   - Potential features include data visualization, advanced filtering and searching, user authentication, and feedback mechanisms to improve the survey experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used\n",
    "- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.\n",
    "- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the GUI.\n",
    "- **SQLite**: For database management.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and export to Excel.\n",
